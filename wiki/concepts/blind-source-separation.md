# Blind Source Separation

**Blind Source Separation (BSS)** is the task of recovering individual source signals from observed mixtures without knowledge of the mixing process or the source signals themselves. In audio, BSS aims to separate speech or sound sources from multichannel microphone recordings in reverberant environments.

## Problem Formulation

In the time domain, a convolutive mixture is modeled as:

$$x_m[t] = \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{\ell=0}^{L-1} a_{mn}[\ell]\, s_n[t-\ell] + b_m[t]$$

where $a_{mn}[\ell]$ are room impulse response coefficients, $s_n$ are source signals, and $b_m$ is sensor noise. In the STFT domain this simplifies to instantaneous mixing per frequency bin:

$$\mathbf{x}^{(k)}[z] = \mathbf{A}^{(k)}\mathbf{s}^{(k)}[z]$$

## Main Approaches

| Method | Model | Permutation handling |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| Frequency-domain ICA | Per-bin instantaneous | Post-hoc alignment needed |
| [[concepts/independent-vector-analysis\|IVA]] | Multivariate across freq bins | Built into cost function |
| [[concepts/switching-independent-vector-analysis\|SwIVA]] | Multiple demixing matrices | Switching mechanism + spatial regularization |
| ILRMA | IVA + NMF source model | Via NMF spectral structure |
| [[concepts/fastmnmf\|FastMNMF]] | Full-rank SCM + NMF | Joint diagonalization |

## AI-Based BSS Taxonomy

[[sources/ansari-2023-ai-bss-survey|Ansari et al. 2023]] propose a distinctive three-way taxonomy of **AI-based BSS approaches**, complementing the classical statistical BSS lineage (ICA/IVA/ILRMA/FastMNMF) tabulated above. The survey consolidates ~60 surveyed papers (2003–2023) into:

| Approach | Representative algorithms | Surveyed references |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Classical machine learning** | FNN, variational Bayes / VB-EM, customized EM, MLP, WMM-MAP, MAP, DBSCAN, K-means, AP, SVM, fuzzy c-means, RBF, CSKC, BNN, ANN, KAM, RF, IBM, K-hyperline clustering, CFSFDP, bigradient neural network | [89, 102–109, 111–113, 115–123, 135, 149–161, 174] |
| **Deep learning** | DNN, RNN, CNN, Conv-TasNet, BLSTM, DRNN, GAN, DAN, deep clustering, GRU, LSTM, deep fully CDAE, BRNN, mixed-type detection hierarchical DNN, VAE, GAN+VAEM, Transformer-based networks (SepFormer, Demucs) | [86, 97, 124–126, 129–137, 162–172] |
| **Evolutionary / swarm intelligence** | PSO, GA, CGA, BCO, ACO, DE, ABC, HEPSO, QPSO, BCC, BCA, DNPSO, quantum GA, FPA, cat swarm | [138–140, 142–148, 173–182] |

The survey benchmarks these methods across audio, speech, music, voice, and source separation applications (Tables 1, 5, 6) and contrasts their computational complexity (Tables 7, 8). Key cross-method findings:

- **DL dominates when labeled data is abundant** but at substantially higher computational cost than classical statistical methods.
- **Classical ML reaches strong SIR/SDR on synthetic data** (e.g., FastICA with ML contrast: SDR 49.70 dB / SIR 51.33 dB / SAR 54.76 dB), but performance is data-specific.
- **Evolutionary methods** are most often used to optimize ICA / FastICA contrast functions or solve nonlinear BSS; their performance is problem-dependent (MABC+covariance-ratio reaches SNR 25.84 dB on speech/music, while ABC permutation alignment reaches only SDR 1.85 dB).
- **Heterogeneous metrics across studies** make fair cross-study comparison difficult; the survey calls for a standardized perceptual evaluation framework and explicit Big-O complexity reporting.
- **Open challenges**: speed/accuracy trade-off, multipurpose BSS models, robustness/scalability, underdetermined convolutive cases, non-harmonic instruments, nonlinear mixing, hybrid ML models, edge/mobile/on-device deployment, and transfer learning for data-scarce domains.

## Geometrically Constrained BSS

Instead of treating spatial information as a post-hoc selection or alignment cue, **geometrically constrained BSS** builds it directly into the optimization: beamforming-derived linear constraints on the far-field responses of the demixing filters (steering-vector inner products pushed toward unity for distortionless response or toward zero for spatial nulls) are added to the BSS objective. This lets a designer control the spatial and frequency responses of the separated outputs, e.g., guaranteeing which channel extracts the target and dedicating another channel to an interference/noise reference. [[sources/li-2020-geometrically-constrained-iva|Li & Koishida 2020]] instantiate this with IVA (see [[concepts/geometrically-constrained-iva|Geometrically Constrained IVA]]), deriving a convergence-guaranteed auxiliary-function algorithm so the constraints come at no cost to AuxIVA's stability, and demonstrating that a two-microphone geometrically constrained system beats both an MPDR beamformer and oracle-selected AuxIVA in SDR/SIR. The follow-up ([[sources/li-2020-online-gciva|Li, Koishida & Makino 2020]]) makes the constrained algorithm **online** (real-time, frame-wise updates via an [[concepts/online-iva|autoregressive auxiliary-variable recursion]]) and shows the geometric constraints are what keep it robust where unconstrained online BSS fails — in an underdetermined noisy condition, online GCAV-IVA reaches 6.86 dB SDR while online AuxIVA nearly fails at 1.70 dB. Related spatial-guidance mechanisms are surveyed under [[concepts/spatial-regularization|spatial regularization]]. A real-world checkpoint for this family: [[sources/hu-2023-gc-auxiva-iss-realistic|Hu & Chen 2023]] reproduced the inverse-free GC-AuxIVA-ISS variant and tested it in three realistic scenes — in low-reverberation conditions (anechoic chamber, outdoor) the constrained BSS delivered clean separation and exact output-order control, but in a highly reverberant meeting room (RT60 ≈ 600 ms) with 70 dBA diffuse bubble noise, DoA-based order control failed and separated outputs stayed contaminated. The authors' diagnosis via the ML/Gaussianity argument (real noise not "Gaussian enough" to be ignored by the separation criterion) supports a broader lesson: **single-stage BSS is insufficient in noisy reverberant real environments** and must be combined with dereverberation and denoising pre/post-processing.

## Key Challenges

- **Permutation ambiguity**: Each frequency bin is solved independently in ICA, so source ordering may differ across bins. Post-hoc [[concepts/permutation-alignment|permutation alignment]] resolves it — and can be made cheap: a confidence-thresholded local-first scheme matches state-of-the-art alignment quality at 4–5× lower runtime ([[sources/kang-2019-low-complexity-permutation-alignment|Kang, Yang & Yang 2019]]); IVA/ILRMA-class methods avoid the problem by construction; [[sources/low-2004-hybrid-bss-anc|Low & Nordholm 2004]] instead avoid misalignment at the source, initializing every subband unmixing matrix as a beamformer-like null toward an arbitrary jammer direction so that adaptation starts from a consistently ordered solution (with scaling fixed by a unit-determinant/volume-conservation constraint).
- **Scaling ambiguity**: Source magnitudes are not identifiable without additional constraints.
- **Underdetermined mixtures**: When sources outnumber microphones ($N > M$), full separation requires sparse/structured priors.
- **Computational cost**: Joint optimization over all frequency bins is expensive; efficient update rules ([[concepts/iterative-projection|IP]], [[concepts/iterative-source-steering|ISS]], AuxIVA) are critical — for single-source extraction, FIVE's global auxiliary-function minimization reaches peak performance in a handful of iterations (Scheibler & Ono 2020).

## Applications

- Meeting transcription (multi-speaker separation)
- Hearing aids and hearables
- Robot audition
- Music source separation
- Hands-free speech enhancement front-ends — hybrid BSS+ANC cascades where the BSS's interference-dominant outputs are reused as adaptive-noise-canceller references ([[sources/low-2004-hybrid-bss-anc|Low & Nordholm 2004]])

## BSS as A Priori Estimator for Model-Based Extraction

The division between BSS and model-based multichannel filtering blurs when BSS is used offline to *supply* the model: [[sources/pan-2026-array-self-awareness|Pan, Chen & Benesty 2026]] estimate the required interference coherence matrices blindly by running offline ILRMA on the first seconds of observations (the source-to-sensor impulse responses are embedded in the demixing matrix), then switch to their [[concepts/array-self-awareness|array self-awareness]] framework for real-time extraction. In a source-switching experiment, recursive AuxIVA and ILRMA (window length 2048) needed more than 5 seconds to re-converge after the desired source changed, while the model-based approach adapted almost immediately with an 8× smaller window (256) — BSS provides the a priori statistics; the parametric method provides the tracking and the low latency.

## Historical Context

[[sources/richard-2023-audio-signal-processing-21st-century|Richard et al. 2023]] trace the 25-year evolution of audio BSS along two branches. The **determined case** moved from frequency-domain ICA (with its permutation/scaling ambiguities resolved by spatial and spectral source information) through TRINICON (an information-theoretic cost exploiting nonwhiteness, nongaussianity, and nonstationarity), IVA, ILRMA (combining ICA spatial info with NMF spectral structure), to the DNN-augmented multichannel VAE (MVAE). The **monophonic / underdetermined case** moved from trained NMF dictionaries, through W-disjoint-orthogonality binary masking and deep clustering, to discriminative mask-prediction networks (now dominant, spanning on-device enhancers and offline music-separation models used in award-winning Beatles restorations). Open questions highlighted by the retrospective include universal separators, limited-data learning, and out-of-distribution generalization.
